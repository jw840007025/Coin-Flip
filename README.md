# Coin-Flip
Guess if your computer flipped heads or tails!  Write a program that lets the user continuously guess whether the flip of a coin results in heads or tails.  The program randomly generates an interger 0 or 1, which represents heads or tails, and it also reports whether the guess is correct or not.
